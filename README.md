# Nintendo Switch Port of ONScripter

![Best girl!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44071820/163734092-8af278e1-4d5c-4fc7-985b-5f86f8093ee6.png)


A port of [onscripter-20060724-insani-sdl2](http://www.github.com/clamintus/onscripter-20060724-insani-sdl2) to the Switch.

I specifically made this to support running older NScripter-based games that would break on newer versions of ONScripter or ONScripter-EN.

## Features
- 4:3 aspect ratio simulation
- Touchscreen support
- RomFS integration
- Optimized flush implementation

## Tested games
- Tsukihime
- Kagetsu Tohya

I'm planning on testing other visual novels too.

Any game that uses legacy ONScripter should run just fine though. If not, please open an issue! :)

## How to Play
- Extract `onscripter-nx.zip` (or a game-specific zip from the releases) to the root of your SD card
- Go to the folder where `onscripter-nx.nro` is located (`/switch/` followed by `onscripter-nx/` or game-specific folder name)
- Copy the game files in that folder:
    - `arc*.nsa` / `arc*.sar`
    - `nscript.dat` / `nscript.___`
        - You don't need this if you are using a game-specific version of ONScripter-NX.
    - Soundtracks (`CD` folder, ...)
    - `default.ttf` font
        - You don't need this if you are using a game-specific version of ONScripter-NX.
- Launch ONScripter-NX from hbmenu
    - _Note:_ Launching from the album applet seems to work, but it is strongly advised to launch it by holding R on an installed game to avoid potential memory problems since that's the normal environment where Switch homebrews are designed to run.
- Enjoy!

## Building instructions
- You need [devkitPro](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment) in order to build ONScripter-NX and its external libraries.
- Open the shell (devkitPro MSYS if on Windows)
- Install the dependencies packages
    - the switch-dev metapackage: `pacman -S --needed switch-dev`
    - SDL2: `pacman -S --needed switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_image switch-sdl2_mixer switch-sdl2_ttf`
    - SMPEG2: `pacman -S --needed switch-smpeg2`
    - libvorbis: `pacman -S --needed switch-libvorbis`
- **IMPORTANT!** At the time of writing this, the switch-sdl2_ttf package available through devkitPro pacman is broken and causes the app to not display text properly.
If it happens to you, please see the following section for building the external libraries, where I've provided a patch for switch-sdl2_ttf.
- If you want to integrate all your game files in one executable, put them in the `romfs` folder
- In your open shell, `cd` to the folder of this repository
- Run `make`

### Building external libraries
- Open the shell (devkitPro MSYS if on Windows)
- Install the dependencies packages
    - the patch utility: `pacman -S --needed patch`
    - devkitPro helper scripts: `pacman -S --needed dkp-toolchain-vars`
- In your open shell, `cd` to the folder of this repository
- Run `make -f Makefile.extlibs`
